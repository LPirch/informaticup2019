\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented our solution to this year's InformatiCup. 
All submitted images of which none resembles a traffic sign, cause the remote model to misclassify with a confidence of over 99\%. 
Furthermore, we presented the software that was used to create these images and which is able to reliable transform random source images into high confidence adversarial examples that fool a given remote model. 
To show the validity of our results, we evaluated them for multiple attack configurations and found that our best attack is able to create transferable adversarial examples with a probability of 78\%.
